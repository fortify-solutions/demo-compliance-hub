# CLAUDE.md - AMLBoost Audit Project

## Project Overview

AMLBoost Audit is an advanced React application demonstrating a comprehensive AML (Anti-Money Laundering) transaction monitoring compliance system for financial institutions. The system focuses specifically on **transaction monitoring capabilities** rather than case management or sanctions screening, providing a dedicated interface for monitoring rule performance, alert investigation workflows, and regulatory compliance tracking.

**Live Application:** https://scaling-adventure-gg8gvqm.pages.github.io/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/fortify-solutions/amlboost-audit (Internal)

The application was designed and built through collaborative sessions between a human product owner and Claude, with a focus on creating a Risk Manager-centric interface for ongoing compliance monitoring and audit readiness.

## Key Design Decisions

### User Persona & Use Case
- **Primary User**: Risk Manager (single role design)
- **Primary Use Case**: Ongoing compliance monitoring with "always audit-ready" approach
- **Secondary Output**: Generate artifacts for internal analysis and external audit packages
- **Language**: Business-focused terminology, no technical SQL/code exposure

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Alert-Driven Workflow**: AI-powered background monitoring triggers actionable insights
- **Clause-Level Granularity**: All compliance tracking happens at the regulatory clause level
- **Metadata-Driven Associations**: Rules linked to clauses through shared taxonomy (jurisdiction, product type, customer type, risk level)
- **Dual Artifact Strategy**: Internal operational reports vs. formal audit packages

### Technical Stack Choices
- **React 19.1.1 + Vite 7.1.2**: Modern development experience with fast HMR
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.4**: Utility-first styling (downgraded from v4 for compatibility)
- **Lucide React**: Consistent, professional iconography
- **Mock Data Services**: Comprehensive regulatory framework simulation
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted deployment with automated build process
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components following established patterns

## Data Model Design

### Regulatory Documents
- Hierarchical structure (Document ‚Üí Clauses)
- Each document has aggregate compliance score
- Support for multiple jurisdictions (US, UK, EU)

### Clauses
- Individual regulatory requirements with full text
- Metadata taxonomy: jurisdiction, product type, customer type, risk level
- Scoring system (0-100%) with red-orange-green visualization
- Evidence tracking with quality assessments
- Linked to monitoring rules through metadata matching

### Monitoring Rules
- Performance metrics: alerts/month, true positive rate, alerts investigated
- Backtest scores and coverage percentages
- Linked to clauses through shared metadata
- Support for different rule categories (Cash Monitoring, Behavioral Analytics, Velocity Tracking, etc.)
- **Focus**: Pure transaction monitoring (no SAR filing or sanctions screening)

### System Alerts
- Types: Performance degradation, coverage gaps, AI insights, regulatory updates
- Priority levels: High, Medium, Low
- Contextual linking to specific clauses and rules
- Action recommendations and impact assessments

### Analyst Capacity Modeling
- **Multi-scenario analysis**: -2, -1, current, +1, +2 analyst staffing options
- **Dynamic threshold modeling**: Investigation thresholds from $5K (10 analysts) to $100K (6 analysts)
- **Comprehensive ROI analysis**: Both investment costs and cost savings scenarios
- **Utilization optimization**: Traffic light system (Green <75%, Yellow 75-85%, Red >85%)
- **Impact visualization**: Positive/negative coverage and workload implications

## Key Features Implemented

### üéØ Three-Panel Dashboard Layout
- **Left Panel**: Regulatory document tree with hierarchical navigation

- Action recommendations with business impact analysis

### üë• Enhanced Capacity Planning Interface
- **5-scenario modeling**: Full spectrum from -2 to +2 analyst adjustments
- **Current baseline**: 8 analysts, 87% utilization, $50K+ investigation threshold
- **Expansion scenarios**: +1 analyst (78% util, $10K threshold), +2 analysts (71% util, $5K threshold)
- **Reduction scenarios**: -1 analyst (92% util, $75K threshold), -2 analysts (95% util, $100K threshold)
- **Dynamic impact analysis**: Real-time coverage, cost, and risk assessment for each scenario
- **Smart color coding**: Green/yellow/red indicators for utilization rates and impact metrics
- **Comprehensive ROI modeling**: Investment costs vs. cost savings with investigation volume changes
- **Focus**: Investigation workflow optimization rather than SAR filing metrics

### üìã Evidence Management
- Quality-scored evidence (Excellent, Good, Fair)
- Multiple evidence types: rule performance, backtest results, audit reports
- Audit trail preparation for regulatory examinations

## Development Challenges Encountered

### Tailwind CSS Configuration Resolution
- **Problem**: Tailwind v4 utilities not being recognized, causing malformed appearance
- **Root Cause**: Tailwind v4 has breaking changes in PostCSS integration
- **Solution Applied**: Downgraded to Tailwind v3.4.4 with proper PostCSS configuration
- **Custom Styling**: Added score styling classes in index.css for compliance visualization
- **Result**: Fully functional styling with proper color schemes and layouts

### GitHub Pages Deployment Challenges
- **Issue**: Internal repository deployment with incorrect base paths
- **Root Cause**: Internal repos use different URL structure than public repos
- **Solution**: Set Vite base to '/' instead of '/repo-name/' for internal repositories
- **Cache Issues**: Required deleting and recreating gh-pages branch to clear old builds
- **Final Result**: Successfully deployed to https://scaling-adventure-gg8gvqm.pages.github.io/

## Mock Data Highlights

The application includes comprehensive mock data representing:
- **3 Major Regulatory Frameworks**: BSA, PATRIOT Act, FinCEN Transaction Monitoring
- **1 Internal Policy Document**: Transaction Monitoring Policy with governance and procedures
- **11 Detailed Clauses**: 8 regulatory + 3 internal policy clauses, each with full text, metadata, and linked rules
- **12 Monitoring Rules**: Realistic performance metrics and backtesting data
- **Active Alert System**: 5 different alert types including policy compliance alerts with varying priorities
- **Capacity Modeling**: Current and projected analyst scenarios

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Technical Fixes

## Key Learning Outcomes

1. **User-Centered Design**: Starting with persona definition (Risk Manager) led to much cleaner feature prioritization
2. **Metadata-Driven Architecture**: Using shared metadata taxonomy creates powerful associations between regulatory requirements and monitoring rules
3. **Alert-Driven UX**: Background AI monitoring with prioritized alerts creates proactive compliance management
4. **Dual Artifact Strategy**: Separating internal operational reports from formal audit packages addresses different stakeholder needs
5. **Capacity Planning Integration**: Showing business impact ("investigate $10K+ vs $50K+") makes technical decisions more compelling

This project demonstrates how thoughtful UX design and comprehensive data modeling can create sophisticated compliance tools that actually help risk managers do their jobs more effectively, rather than just checking regulatory boxes.
