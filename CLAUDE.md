# CLAUDE.md - AMLBoost Audit Project

## Project Overview

AMLBoost Audit is an advanced React application demonstrating a comprehensive AML (Anti-Money Laundering) transaction monitoring compliance system for financial institutions. The system focuses specifically on **transaction monitoring capabilities** rather than case management or sanctions screening, providing a dedicated interface for monitoring rule performance, alert investigation workflows, and regulatory compliance tracking.

**Live Application:** https://scaling-adventure-gg8gvqm.pages.github.io/  
**Repository:** https://github.com/fortify-solutions/amlboost-audit (Internal)

The application was designed and built through collaborative sessions between a human product owner and Claude, with a focus on creating a Risk Manager-centric interface for ongoing compliance monitoring and audit readiness.

## Key Design Decisions

### User Persona & Use Case
- **Primary User**: Risk Manager (single role design)
- **Primary Use Case**: Ongoing compliance monitoring with "always audit-ready" approach
- **Secondary Output**: Generate artifacts for internal analysis and external audit packages
- **Language**: Business-focused terminology, no technical SQL/code exposure

### Architecture Philosophy
- **Alert-Driven Workflow**: AI-powered background monitoring triggers actionable insights
- **Requirement-Level Granularity**: All compliance tracking happens at the regulatory requirement level
- **Metadata-Driven Associations**: Rules linked to requirements through shared taxonomy (jurisdiction, product type, customer type, risk level)
- **Dual Artifact Strategy**: Internal operational reports vs. formal audit packages
- **Performance-Focused Analytics**: System emphasizes operational metrics (alert volumes, true positive rates, coverage percentages) over subjective scoring

### Technical Stack Choices
- **React 19.1.1 + Vite 7.1.2**: Modern development experience with fast HMR
- **Tailwind CSS v3.4.4**: Utility-first styling (downgraded from v4 for compatibility)
- **Lucide React**: Consistent, professional iconography
- **Mock Data Services**: Comprehensive regulatory framework simulation
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosted deployment with automated build process
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components following established patterns

### Monitoring Rules
- Performance metrics: alerts/month, true positive rate, alerts investigated
- Backtest scores and coverage percentages
- Linked to clauses through shared metadata
- Support for different rule categories (Cash Monitoring, Behavioral Analytics, Velocity Tracking, etc.)
- **Focus**: Pure transaction monitoring (no SAR filing or sanctions screening)

### System Alerts
- Types: Performance degradation, coverage gaps, AI insights, regulatory updates

6. **Performance Over Perception**: Focusing on quantifiable metrics rather than subjective scores leads to more actionable insights
7. **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design patterns enable rapid feature development without breaking existing functionality
8. **Interactive Configuration Systems**: Transforming static displays into editable interfaces dramatically improves user engagement and system utility
9. **Reactive State Management**: Event-driven architecture with shared services enables seamless data propagation across complex component hierarchies
10. **Realistic Demo Data**: Using varied, business-realistic values instead of random data significantly improves demonstration credibility

This project demonstrates how thoughtful UX design and comprehensive data modeling can create sophisticated compliance tools that actually help risk managers do their jobs more effectively, rather than just checking regulatory boxes.
