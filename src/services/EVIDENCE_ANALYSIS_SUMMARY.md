# Evidence-Rule Linkage Analysis Summary

## Executive Summary

**Result**: ✅ **NO ISSUES FOUND** - The mockData.js file is correctly structured with all evidence-rule associations properly maintained.

**Analysis Date**: 2025-10-09
**File Analyzed**: `/Users/tom/Documents/AML/demo-aml-compliance-hub/src/services/mockData.js`
**Total Size**: 51,217 tokens

---

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Data Structure Understanding

The mockData.js file contains three main interconnected data structures:

#### A. Rules (25 total)
Each rule has:
- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `rule-eu-01`)
- `linkedClauses`: Array of requirement IDs this rule implements
- Example: `rule-eu-05` is linked to 10 different requirements

#### B. Regulatory Requirements (38 with rules)
Each requirement (clause) has:
- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `germany-aml-section-1`)
- `linkedRules`: Array of rule IDs that implement this requirement
- `linkedEvidence`: Array of evidence IDs supporting the rules (optional)

#### C. Master Evidence List (36 evidence items)
Evidence entries have:
- `id`: Unique identifier (e.g., `ev-backtest-001`)
- `type`: backtest, threshold-sensitivity, atl-btl-test, or scenario-test
- `description`: What was tested
- `category`: Type of monitoring

## Analysis Methodology

### Step 1: Extract Rule-to-Requirement Mappings
Parsed all 25 rules and extracted their `linkedClauses` arrays to build a mapping of which rules implement which requirements.

**Result**:
- 25 rules found
- 38 unique requirements have associated rules
- Mapping complete and validated

### Step 2: Build Reverse Mapping (Requirement-to-Rules)
Inverted the mapping to determine which rules SHOULD be declared in each requirement's `linkedRules` array.

**Result**: Complete reverse mapping created for all 38 requirements

### Step 3: Validate All linkedRules Arrays
Checked every requirement's `linkedRules` array against the expected rules from Step 2.

**Clauses Checked**: 139 total clauses examined
**Requirements with Rules**: 38 requirements have linkedRules arrays
**Mismatches Found**: **0**

## Detailed Findings

### ✅ All Evidence-Rule Associations Are Correct

Every requirement's `linkedRules` array exactly matches what the rules declare in their `linkedClauses`. Examples:

#### Example 1: germany-aml-section-4
- **Declared linkedRules**: `['rule-eu-01', 'rule-eu-07', 'rule-eu-08', 'rule-eu-19']`
- **Expected from rules**: `['rule-eu-01', 'rule-eu-07', 'rule-eu-08', 'rule-eu-19']`
- **Status**: ✅ Perfect match

#### Example 2: italy-aml-section-1
- **Declared linkedRules**: `['rule-eu-02', 'rule-eu-05', 'rule-eu-09', 'rule-eu-10', 'rule-eu-11', 'rule-eu-23', 'rule-eu-24']`
- **Expected from rules**: `['rule-eu-02', 'rule-eu-05', 'rule-eu-09', 'rule-eu-10', 'rule-eu-11', 'rule-eu-23', 'rule-eu-24']`
- **Status**: ✅ Perfect match

#### Example 3: fatf-method-effectiveness
- **Declared linkedRules**: `['rule-eu-20', 'rule-eu-21']`
- **Expected from rules**: `['rule-eu-20', 'rule-eu-21']`
- **Status**: ✅ Perfect match

### ✅ All Requirements with Evidence Have Corresponding Rules

Initially flagged 22 requirements as "having linkedEvidence but missing linkedRules", but upon detailed inspection, all 22 actually DO have correct linkedRules arrays:

1. ✅ eu-amld5-art33
2. ✅ germany-aml-section-3
3. ✅ germany-aml-section-4
4. ✅ germany-aml-section-5
5. ✅ italy-aml-section-3
6. ✅ italy-aml-section-4
7. ✅ italy-aml-section-5
8. ✅ spain-aml-section-3
9. ✅ spain-aml-section-4
10. ✅ spain-aml-section-5
11. ✅ fatf-rec16-wire
12. ✅ fatf-rec20-suspicious
13. ✅ fatf-complex-unusual
14. ✅ fatf-corr-unusual
15. ✅ fatf-corr-rfi
16. ✅ fatf-corr-nested
17. ✅ fatf-method-rec16
18. ✅ fatf-method-rec20
19. ✅ fatf-method-effectiveness
20. ✅ fatf-rba-automated
21. ✅ fatf-rba-technology
22. ✅ fatf-rba-testing

All 22 have proper linkedRules that match their associated rules' declarations.

## Rule Coverage Distribution

### Most Connected Requirements (Top 5)
1. **italy-aml-section-5**: 7 rules
   - rule-eu-05, rule-eu-09, rule-eu-10, rule-eu-11, rule-eu-23, rule-eu-24, rule-eu-25

2. **italy-aml-section-3**: 5 rules
   - rule-eu-06, rule-eu-07, rule-eu-11, rule-eu-23, rule-eu-25

3. **italy-aml-section-1**: 7 rules
   - rule-eu-02, rule-eu-05, rule-eu-09, rule-eu-10, rule-eu-11, rule-eu-23, rule-eu-24

4. **germany-aml-section-4**: 4 rules
   - rule-eu-01, rule-eu-07, rule-eu-08, rule-eu-19

5. **germany-aml-section-1**: 4 rules

## Data Integrity Patterns Observed

### Positive Patterns (Good Practices)
1. **Bidirectional Consistency**: Every rule's `linkedClauses` is mirrored by the clause's `linkedRules`
2. **Evidence Association**: Requirements with `linkedEvidence` also have corresponding `linkedRules`
3. **No Orphaned Rules**: All 25 rules are linked to at least one requirement
4. **No Orphaned Requirements**: All requirements with evidence have corresponding rules
5. **Visible Document Focus**: The 10 visible documents (EU, Germany, Italy, Spain, FATF) have complete rule coverage

### Architecture Notes
- Evidence items in `masterEvidenceList` don't directly reference rules - they're associated via requirements
- Evidence types (backtest, threshold-sensitivity, atl-btl-test, scenario-test) provide flexible testing documentation
- The evidence-requirement-rule linkage is metadata-driven through shared taxonomy

## Verification Scripts Created

Three Python analysis scripts were created during this review:

1. **analyze_evidence.py**: Initial evidence-rule reference checker
2. **analyze_evidence_v2.py**: Enhanced clause evidence analyzer
3. **analyze_linked_rules.py**: Comprehensive linkedRules validation (final verification)

All scripts and results are available in `/Users/tom/Documents/AML/demo-aml-compliance-hub/src/services/`

---

## Conclusion

The mockData.js file is **correctly structured** with:
- ✅ All 25 rules properly linked to requirements
- ✅ All 38 requirements correctly declaring their implementing rules
- ✅ All 30 requirements with evidence have corresponding rule associations
- ✅ Bidirectional consistency between rules and requirements
- ✅ No orphaned rules or requirements
- ✅ No incorrect evidence-rule associations

**No changes needed** to the mockData.js file.

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Automated Testing**: Consider adding unit tests that validate linkedRules consistency
2. **Schema Validation**: Implement JSON schema validation for the data structures
3. **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments explaining the evidence-requirement-rule relationship
4. **Visibility Toggle**: When changing `visible: false` to `visible: true`, ensure rule associations are still valid
